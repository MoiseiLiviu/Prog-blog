<p style='letter-spacing:1px;font-size:20px;padding-right:24vw;'> This site was created with the purpose of sharing coding problems solutions,

with upcoming competitive programmers.

Most of the problems are taken from Uva, and suggested by Competitive Programming 3 authors for practice.

The language i use is c++ because it allows the fastest and most efficient io and for the 
STL library but Java or Phyton are fine for most of the problems too.

For questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me.</p>
